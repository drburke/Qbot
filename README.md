# Qbot

Repo started from one of the scripts in my tensorflow repo.  This one will be a bit more focused on reinforcement learning.  And will be an extended work in progress.

## Lunar Lander

I found what seems to be a great and clean implementation of A3C at https://github.com/jaara/AI-blog/blob/master/CartPole-A3C.py.  Will be using this as my starting point on the aigym lunar lander.  Then I'll be trying out different techniques and working improve the learning behaviour.  

* Added a wrapper script to work as a grid search for optimizing hyper-parameters.
